FINAL PROJECT

My final web design project is a professionally-oriented three-page website dedicated to BLACKPINK, one of the most globally influential K-pop girl groups. The purpose of this site is to highlight the groupâ€™s members, multimedia content, and achievements in an elegant, responsive, and engaging layout. On the Home page, I will feature a large hero section with a rotating carousel of high-resolution images of BLACKPINK, followed by a brief introduction. The Members page will showcase each member in individual interactive cards, including bios and toggle buttons to reveal more details. The Media page will include embedded audio clips of their songs and optimized images with srcset attributes for high-DPI displays. Navigation links will be placed at the top of every page, and each layout will be styled with responsive grid or flexbox structure to adapt to mobile and desktop views. The overall visual style will use BLACKPINK's iconic theme colors (black and pink) and custom fonts. Accessibility and interactivity through JavaScript will also be integrated to meet all 15 grading points.
